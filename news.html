        <strong>
          The preparations of the national teams for the new season 2022/2023 are in full swing. But no team faces a
          greater challenge that the Ukrainian athletes, who have to solve many different problems related to the
          participation of the squad in international competitions.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Six biathletes of the national team: Dmytro Pidruchnyi, Artem Pryma, Bogdan Tsymbal, Anton Dudchenko, Taras
        Lesiuk, Denys Nasyko, and Darya Blashko, who also works with her male teammates, are having their second
        training camp in Oberhof. The first camp was held in Ukrainian Sianky (Lviv region), where the men’s head coach
        Juraj Sanitra managed to gather the main team: “For me, first of all, it was important to look into the eyes of
        my athletes, to understand how they look at the situation and what they think."
      </p>

      <p>
        Sanitra, who has been working with the Ukrainian team for 6 years, recalls how unexpectedly the last season was
        interrupted after Beijing: “When everyone went home after the Olympics on February 21, no one thought that we
        would not go to the last trimester of the World Cup. Back then we already had planned on how to start working
        for the next Olympic cycle. But that all changed on February 24, when Russia's aggression against Ukraine
        began."
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://assets.biathlonworld.com/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_1080,q_auto/Photo%20Database/2021-2022/OWG%20Beijing%202022/Men%20Relay/Tsymbal150222cm2643"
        alt="biathlonist-1" class="image-content">
      <p>
        The coach recalls: "In those days there was all sorts of information and phone conversations, I was very worried
        about all the athletes and coaches, as well as fans, which there are so many in Ukraine. I helped in any way I
        could. For five weeks, my athlete's family lived at my house... This is a very difficult time, and I thought for
        a long time about whether to continue working or not. I talked to my family and realised that I can’t leave my
        athletes, Ukrainian biathlon, and colleagues at a time when they need help.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Sanitra does not know what will happen tomorrow, but he is sure that biathlon has existed and will exist in
        Ukraine, so he continues to work persistently.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to come to Germany for a training camp, it was necessary to solve one main issue: obtaining permission
        that would allow biathletes to leave Ukraine. The country is at war and many of the athletes were in service
        either in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) or in the National Guard: “We were constantly in touch and together
        we thought about how to work further, - the coach says. I know that almost right after Beijing, the guys were
        called up to perform army tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, you can feel a shortage in training, but I can see in their eyes that they are ready to do the
        hardest training work to be well prepared. After all, this is their opportunity to show that Ukraine is a strong
        country and can have its own position in the world. And sport is a good form of presenting your country in the
        world.”
      </p>

      <img

        alt="trainer" class="image-content">
      <p>
        When Sanitra decided to work with the Ukrainian team, first he thought about the moral state of his athletes; he
        worried that some personal problems might interfere because everyone has families and relatives in Ukraine, and
        no one knows what can happen at any moment. The main task he faces today is to fill in the gaps in the training
        of all team members who have not had the opportunity to train for almost two months: “Ukrainian top biathletes
        are now in different stages of preparation for the season. We did a very good job in terms of volume and
        quantity in the previous Olympic cycle. And I think that we will manage to do everything if we work according to
        the programme that we have for the summer period; it will help to raise the guys to a good level.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The captain of the Ukrainian national team, Dmytro Pidruchnyi, who served in the National Guard almost from the
        beginning of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, is also concerned about his shape: “Once a week I was allowed
        to go home, and I was running so that at least for an hour my heart and muscles would remember what a load is. I
        also got sick with covid, so I started to train only in mid-May, and the first training sessions were very
        difficult. However, step by step, we are now trying to restore the form to return to the previous level. I feel
        that my shape is a month or month and a half “behind” from the one I usually had during this period. But I have
        already begun to feel the rhythm and I’m starting to catch up on the guys."
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://assets.biathlonworld.com/image/upload/f_auto,c_limit,w_1080,q_auto/Website%20Stories/Lesiuk_Pidruchnyi_in_Oberhof"
        alt="team-players" class="image-content">
      <p>
        Pidruchnyi admits that the situation in Ukraine affects him a lot: "Of course, everything that happens at home
        cannot but affect the mood and mindset; it is difficult to separate yourself from the country. You know there is
        a war going on and people are dying, that the AFU stands as a wall, giving us the opportunity to train here as
        well. But you go to training and think about what you need to do now, you focus all your attention here”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artem Pryma, for whom the last season ended early and unexpectedly, was on service in the AFU during this time:
        “Three days after our return home from the Olympics, the war began and there could no longer be any training. I
        tried to somehow keep in shape, but I was in my military unit. And I was allowed to go to the first training
        camp already from there.”
      </p>

        alt="biathlonist-2" class="image-content">
      <p>
        “All this hard work that we do, - says Sanitra, - we dedicate this to our fans and all citizens of the country
        so that in such a difficult time they can find some joy in the success of Ukrainian biathletes, because biathlon
        is one of the most popular sports in Ukraine. I want people to look at the representatives of their country and
        be happy for their success.”

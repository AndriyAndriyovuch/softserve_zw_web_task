      <p>
        The Ukrainian biathlon team has a rich and successful history in the sport. Biathlon, a combination of
        cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, has been a popular winter sport in Ukraine for many decades. The
        Ukrainian athletes have consistently showcased their skills and determination, earning numerous accolades
        and achieving remarkable milestones on the international stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Ukrainian biathlon team emerged as a formidable force in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Ukraine
        gained independence from the Soviet Union. With the establishment of the National Biathlon Federation of
        Ukraine in 1991, the team received increased support and resources to develop and excel in the sport.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the Ukrainian biathlon team continued to make a name for itself.
        Athletes such as Sergey Bulygin, Olena Petrova, and Ruslan Pryma showcased their skills and consistently
        achieved podium finishes in major international competitions, including the Biathlon World Cup and World
        Championships.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the team's greatest success came in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The Ukrainian biathletes
        established themselves as dominant forces on the international stage, consistently challenging traditional
        biathlon powerhouses like Germany and Norway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other notable biathletes who played crucial roles in the team's success included Valj Semerenko, Vita
        Semerenko, Juliya Dzhyma, and Dmytro Pidruchnyi. Together, they formed a strong and determined team that
        consistently delivered outstanding performances.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team's success was not without its challenges. Over the years, Ukrainian biathletes faced political and
        economic instability in their country, which affected the availability of resources and training
        opportunities. Despite these obstacles, the athletes remained resilient and continued to compete at the
        highest level, demonstrating their unwavering dedication to the sport.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Ukrainian biathlon team continues to be a force to be reckoned with in international competitions. With
        a new generation of talented biathletes emerging and the ongoing support from the National Biathlon
        Federation of Ukraine, the team is poised to build upon its rich history and achieve even greater success in
        the years to come.

        Germany on Jan. 8 – its first medal in this season of the Biathlon World Cup.

      <p>
        Artem Tyshchenko and Daria Blashko represented Ukraine in the race.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pair got off to a slow start: in the first round, Tyshchenko used four extra cartridges and passed the
        baton in eighth position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blashko then got through the first round shooting without a single miss, but she had two misses on the
        second. Still, this allowed her to move up to second place.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last two rounds, Tyshchenko and Blashko used three additional cartridges each and finished the race
        in third place.
